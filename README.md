# üç≥ Chill to Plate

Welcome to the Chill to Plate project! This repository contains a web application that leverages OpenAI's model to provide personalized cooking ideas based on the ingredients in your refrigerator. The application guides you through step-by-step recipes, ensuring a delightful cooking experience. Upon selecting a Chef, the corresponding AI will appear, ask for your name and ingredients, and then suggest various cooking ideas.

## üéØ Key Features

-   **Chef Selection**: Start a conversation by selecting from various Chefs (Korean, Chinese, American).
-   **Personalized Recipe Recommendations**: AI recommends recipes based on the ingredients you provide.
-   **Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions**: Detailed cooking instructions, tips, and precautions for each recipe.
-   **Contextual Conversation**: Stores conversation history to maintain context throughout the interaction.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

-   **/frontend/public/index.html**: Main HTML entry for the React app
-   **/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component handling chat logic
-   **/frontend/src/style.css**: UI styles for the frontend
-   **/backend/server.js**: Node.js-based server handling OpenAI API calls
-   **/backend/.env**: Environment variables for API keys and configurations

## üí° How It Works

-   **User Chooses a Chef**: On the main page (index.html), the user selects a Chef and waits for the chat header to display ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù.
-   **User Provides Input**: The AI asks for the user‚Äôs name and available ingredients.
-   **Server Communication**: A request is sent from the browser to the backend server (Node.js). The server then forwards the conversation to the OpenAI API along with relevant parameters.
-   **OpenAI Processing**: The AI model (GPT-4o-mini) processes the prompt and returns a response.
-   **Response Display**: The server sends back the AI response to the browser, and the user interface displays the suggestions or next steps.

## üöÄ Installation and Execution

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:
